"""
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example:
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].

Note:


Follow up:
What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
What if nums1's size is small compared to num2's size? Which algorithm is better?
What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot
load all elements into the memory at once?
