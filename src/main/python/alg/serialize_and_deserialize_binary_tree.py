"""
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored
in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or
another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your
serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to
a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following tree
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to
follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms
should be stateless.
